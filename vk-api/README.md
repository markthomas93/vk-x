# vk-api — JavaScript Driver for vk.com API

An alternative library for interacting with vk.com with exceptionally convenient API.

## Install

The driver is packaged as an [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) and is published to:

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vk-x/vk-api): `npm install --save @vk-x/vk-api`
- [jsDelivr CDN](http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/vk-api): `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/vk-api/latest/vk-api.min.js`

## Use

After you've included and loaded the script, you can use it either with Promises or with callbacks.

```JavaScript

// Authenticate on your website.
await vk.authWebsite("app-id", ["permissions"])
const currentUser = await vk.users.get() // https://vk.com/dev/users.get

// Alternatively, obtain the access token yourself.
vk.accessToken = "obtained-access-token"
const currentUser = await vk.users.get() // https://vk.com/dev/users.get

```
